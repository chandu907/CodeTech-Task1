OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
Project : Simple calculator using python
Objective: The objective of creating a simple calculator using Python is to build a program that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. This calculator should take input from the user, perform the desired operation, and then display the result.

Here's a basic outline of how you can achieve this:

Take user input: Prompt the user to enter the numbers they want to perform operations on and the type of operation they want to perform (e.g., addition, subtraction, etc.).

Perform the operation: Based on the user's input, perform the corresponding arithmetic operation.

Display the result: Output the result of the operation to the user.
key Activities: The key activities involved in creating a simple calculator using Python include:

User Input: Prompting the user to input the numbers and select the operation they want to perform.

Performing Operations: Implementing functions or methods to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on the user's choice.

Error Handling: Ensuring that the calculator can handle invalid inputs or divide-by-zero scenarios gracefully.

Displaying Results: Outputting the result of the calculation to the user in a clear and understandable format.

Looping: Optionally, allowing the user to perform multiple calculations without exiting the program by using a loop.

User Interface (optional): Depending on the complexity and intended use of the calculator, you may want to implement a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt.

Here's a breakdown of these activities in a bit more detail:

User Input:

Prompt the user to enter two numbers and select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
Performing Operations:

Implement functions or methods to perform each arithmetic operation. These functions should take two numbers as input and return the result of the operation.
Error Handling:

Check for invalid inputs, such as non-numeric characters or unsupported operations.
Handle divide-by-zero errors if the user selects division.
Displaying Results:

Output the result of the calculation to the user in a clear and understandable format. This could be done through the console or a GUI if you're implementing one.
Looping:

Optionally, allow the user to perform multiple calculations without exiting the program by using a loop (e.g., a while loop that continues until the user chooses to exit).
User Interface (optional):

Depending on your requirements, you may choose to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for the calculator using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt. This can enhance user experience and make the calculator more user-friendly.
